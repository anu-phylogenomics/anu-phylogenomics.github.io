<big>_Associate Professor, Australian National University_</big>


#### Biography

Minh obtained his B.Sc. in Computer Science (2001) from 
[Vietnam National University](https://vnu.edu.vn/eng/), 
M.Sc. in Applied Computer Science (2005) from the 
[University of Freiburg](http://www.uni-freiburg.de) (Germany)
and Ph.D. in Bioinformatics (2009) from the 
[University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at) (Austria).
After a Postdoc at [Max Perutz Labs](https://www.maxperutzlabs.ac.at),
he joined the [Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au) as 
a Research Fellow (2018). He then became Lecturer (2019), Senior Lecturer (2021), 
and currently, Associate Professor since 2024.

#### Research Interests

Minh is the leader of the _Computational Phylogenomics_ Lab. 
His lab's research lies at the interface between Computing, Biology and Statistics, 
with the motto to enable evolutionary research in the genomic era. 
His lab develops bioinformatic methods and algorithms, statistical models of molecular evolution, 
and high-performance computing techniques for phylogenetic inference 
from ultra-large genomic data. 

Minh leads an international team that jointly develops the widely used 
[IQ-TREE software](https://iqtree.github.io). IQ-TREE usages are ranging 
from reconstructing the tree of life to detecting new variations and 
key mutations of the coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic.

His lab has strong collaborations with [Research School of Biology](https://biology.anu.edu.au/),
especially with [Prof. Robert Lanfear's lab](https://biology.anu.edu.au/research/research-groups/lanfear-group-mutation-molecular-evolution-and-phylogenetics).
