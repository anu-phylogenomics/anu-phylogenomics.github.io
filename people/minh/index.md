#### Biography

Minh obtained his B.Sc. in Computer Science (2001) from 
[Vietnam National University](https://vnu.edu.vn/eng/), 
M.Sc. in Applied Computer Science (2005) from the 
[University of Freiburg](http://www.uni-freiburg.de) (Germany)
and Ph.D. in Bioinformatics (2009) from the 
[University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at) (Austria).
After a Postdoc at [Max Perutz Labs](https://www.maxperutzlabs.ac.at),
he joined the [Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au) as a Senior Research Fellow (2018) and 
a Lecturer (2019).

#### Research Interests

Minh is currently the Leader of the _Computational Phylogenomics_ Lab,
jointly affiliated with the 
[Research School of Computer Science](https://cs.anu.edu.au/)
and [Research School of Biology](https://biology.anu.edu.au/), ANU.
His lab focuses on efficient bioinformatic methods, statistical 
models of molecular evolution, algorithms and high performance computing 
techniques for phylogenetics from ultra-large genomic data.
