_Postdoctoral Fellow, Australian National University_


#### Biography

After I received PhD in Bioinformatics from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong, I worked as a post-doctoral fellow in the same university for more than one year and was involved in development of SOAP3 that uses Graphical Processing Unit technology for paralleling the task of aligning short reads of DNA to genomes. Then I came to Canberra and worked as a post-doctoral fellow at CSIRO for three years. I was focusing on modelling the non-stationary evolutionary processes across lineages and across sites for a phylogenetic tree. I am glad to join ANU in 2016 and continue the research on phylogenomic area.

#### Research Interests

My research interest is mainly on the methodologies in phylogenomic area. Due to my Computer Science background, I am interested in developing methodologies and software. My favourite programming language is C++.

Projects

1. Modelling non-stationary evolutionary processes across lineages and across sites
2. Evolutionary analysis on short reads
