Welcome [Huaiyan Ren](/people/huaiyan-ren/)! Huaiyan just joined our group as a PhD student. His research will consist of: (1) estimating (maximum likelihood) substitution matrix mixture model for DNA alignment and apply it to real species data; and (2) applying machine learning approaches (CNN) to mixture model selection.
