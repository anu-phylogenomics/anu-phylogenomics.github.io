We have recently received a prestigious grant funded by the
[The Simons and Moore Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/funded-project/new-phylogenomic-models-and-approaches) 
leaded by PI [Andrew Roger](http://rogerlab.biochemistryandmolecularbiology.dal.ca), 
[Edward Susko](https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~tsusko/), 
[Laura Eme](https://emelaura.com) and Minh Bui(/people/minh/).

The project is about new phylogenomic models and methods to resolve the prokaryote 
to eukaryote transition.
