We have recently received an [Australian Research
Council](https://www.arc.gov.au) discovery grant 2020, together with
Prof. [Allen Rodrigo](https://biology.anu.edu.au/people/academics/allen-rodrigo) (CI)
and A/Prof. [Rob Lanfear](https://www.robertlanfear.com) (co-CI),
H/Prof. [Lars Jermiin](https://biology.anu.edu.au/people/academics/lars-jermiin), and
Prof. [Matt Hahn](https://hahnlab.sitehost.iu.edu). The value is
$422,697 for a three-year Postdoc.

The topic is about **Efficient phylogenetic methods that manage the curse of genomic
complexity**. This project aims to develop new methods and software to
infer the evolutionary history of organisms using genomic data. These
new phylogenomic methods need to take account of the complexity of
evolutionary processes and/or patterns in time (along the evolutionary
tree) and space (along the genome). This project is significant because
these methods must merge mathematics and statistics with
High-Performance Computing to handle the huge quantities of genetic data
and the complexity of evolution itself. An important expected outcome of
this project will be the development and release of freely-available
software that incorporates these new methods. This project expects to
benefit scientists who need to infer phylogenies from genomic data.
