A PhD position is available in the our lab at the [School of Computing](https://comp.anu.edu.au/), 
Australian National University (ANU). We are
looking for a highly motivated student, who will work on the next generation of models and methods for phylogenetic analysis in the genomic era. There are a large number of potential directions that the
research could take, and the details will depend on your interests and experience. Potential directions include: developing machine learning methods for phylogenetics; efficient algorithms for tree search; new approaches to phylogenetic model
selection; co-estimating multiple trees. The student will implement new models and methods in the widely used [IQ-TREE software](http://www.iqtree.org).

The ANU campus is situated in the heart of Australiaâ€™s capital city, Canberra, which is named as the second-best city in the world for quality of life according to [Oxford Economics Global Cities report] (https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/global-cities-index/). The ANU has an international reputation for research excellence and is ranked among the best universities in the world (ranked 30th globally in the QS World University Ranking 2025).

Candidates: ANU scholarships are highly competitive, and cover all fees and a ~$38K stipend per annum. In order to be put forward, you will need excellent undergraduate marks, a high-distiction honours or Masters by research (or be expecting to gain one soon) or equivalent research experience, excellent oral and written English skills.

To apply, please send to m.bui (at) anu.edu.au a detailed CV, full academic transcripts, an English test certificate if English was not the language of your study, and a brief description of your research interests and how they intersect with this project.
