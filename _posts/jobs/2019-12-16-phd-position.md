A PhD position is available in the our lab at the [Research
School of Computer Science](https://cs.anu.edu.au), 
Australian National University (ANU). We are
looking for a highly motivated student, who will work on the next
generation of models and methods for phylogenetic analysis in the
genomic era. There are a large number of potential directions that the
research could take, and the details will depend on your interests and
experience. Potential directions include: developing efficient
algorithms for tree search; new approaches to phylogenetic model
selection; co-estimating multiple trees. The student will implement new
models and methods in the widely used [IQ-TREE software](http://www.iqtree.org).

The ANU campus is situated in the heart of Australia’s capital city,
Canberra, which is ranked as the third best city in the world according
to Lonely Planet (2018) and is Australia’s most liveable city (Life in
Australia Report 2019). The ANU has an international reputation for
research excellence and is ranked among the best universities in the
world (QS World University Ranking 2019).

Candidates: ANU scholarships are highly competitive, and cover all fees
and a ~$27K stipend. In order to be put forward, you will need
outstanding undergraduate marks and a first class honours or Masters by
research (or be expecting to gain one by the middle of 2020) or
equivalent research experience.

To apply, please send to m.bui (at) anu.edu.au a detailed CV, full
academic transcripts, and a brief description of your research interests
and how they intersect with this project. 

The deadline is **January 31, 2020**.
