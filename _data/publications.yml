  title: 'piqtree: A Python Package for Seamless Phylogenetic Inference with IQ-TREE'
  container-title: biorxiv
  publisher: Evolutionary Biology
  genre: preprint
  abstract: 'piqtree is an easy to use, open-source Python package that directly exposes IQ-TREEs phylogenetic inference engine. It offers Python functions for performing many of IQ-TREEs capabilities including phylogenetic reconstruction, ultrafast bootstrapping, branch length optimisation, ModelFinder, rapid neighbour-joining, and more. By exposing IQ-TREEs algorithms within Python, piqtree greatly simplifies the development of new phylogenetic workflows through seamless interoperability with other Python libraries and tools mediated by the cogent3 package. It also enables users to perform interactive analyses with IQ-TREE through, for instance, Jupyter notebooks. We present the key features available in the piqtree library and a small case study that showcases its interoperability. The piqtree library can be installed with "pip install piqtree", with the documentation available at https://piqtree.readthedocs.io and source at https://github.com/iqtree/piqtree.'

  title: 'IQ2MC: A New Framework to Infer Phylogenetic Time Trees Using IQ-TREE 3 and MCMCTree with Mixture Models'
  container-title: ecoevorxiv
  publisher: Evolutionary Biology
  genre: preprint
  abstract: 'IQ-TREE and MCMCTree are two widely used phylogenetic tools to infer phylogenetic trees and estimate divergence times, respectively. As MCMCTree performs fast approximate Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to obtain the times along a fixed tree topology, it would be natural to use IQ-TREE to obtain the tree. However, it is currently not possible to integrate these tools seamlessly, as MCMCTree requires pre-calculation of the gradients and Hessian for fast approximate calculation of the likelihood, which is unavailable in IQ-TREE. Furthermore, MCMCTree only implements a small subset of substitution models; and complex models such as the mixture models are not available. This is an important limitation because complex substitution models are required for reliable estimates of divergence times in deep phylogenies. Here, we introduce a new pipeline IQ2MC, which facilitates the integration of IQ-TREE 3 and MCMCTree, substantially speeds up the pre-calculation steps, and allows the use of a wide range of IQ-TREE’s complex models in divergence time inference. IQ2MC provides an updated version IQ-TREE 3.0.1 to calculate the gradients and Hessian at the maximum likelihood branch lengths, and then MCMCTree is used for MCMC sampling of divergence times. IQ2MC also provides several advanced partition models and mixture models not available in the current MCMCTree workflow. We finally show the applications of IQ2MC on simulated and four empirical datasets of placental mammals, plants, eukaryotes/prokaryotes, and metazoan. A tutorial to use IQ2MC is available at https://iqtree.github.io/doc/Dating.'

  title: 'The Influence of Model Violation on Phylogenetic Inference: A Simulation Study'
  title-short: The Influence of Model Violation on Phylogenetic Inference
  container-title: bioRxiv
  publisher: Evolutionary Biology
  genre: preprint
  abstract: A bstractPhylogenetic inference typically assumes that the data has evolved
    under Stationary, Reversible and Homogeneous (SRH) conditions. Many empirical
    and simulation studies have shown that assuming SRH conditions can lead to significant
    errors in phylogenetic inference when the data violates these assumptions. Yet,
    many simulation studies focused on extreme non-SRH conditions that represent worst-case
    scenarios and not the average empirical dataset. In this study, we simulate datasets
    under various degrees of non-SRH conditions using empirically derived parameters
    to mimic real data and examine the effects of incorrectly assuming SRH conditions
    on inferring phylogenies. Our results show that maximum likelihood inference is
    generally quite robust to a wide range of SRH model violations but is inaccurate
    under extreme convergent evolution.

  title: 'Robust Phylogenetics'
  container-title: bioRxiv
  publisher: Evolutionary Biology
  genre: preprint
  abstract: 'We present a robust phylogenetic inference method, called the trimmed log-likelihood method, which effectively identifies fast-evolving, saturated, or erroneous sites in both simulated and empirical multiple sequence alignments. This method avoids circularity by dynamically identifying and removing sites without relying on an initial tree, allowing the specific sites removed to change as tree topology and branch lengths are estimated. Our analyses demonstrate that this method outperforms existing approaches, such as the Slow-Fast method, Tree Independent Generation of Evolutionary Rate approach, and Le Quesne Probability statistics, by removing fewer sites while still inferring phylogenies with comparable or greater accuracy. Implemented in IQ-TREE2, the trimmed log-likelihood method is user-friendly with a simple command-line interface. However, challenges remain in addressing heterogeneous evolutionary processes including compositional biases, such as GC bias. Despite these challenges, our approach offers a practical solution for improving phylogenetic inference by automatically and dynamically identifying sites to down-weight during phylogenetic analyses. We recommended that researchers compare trees inferred by varying the proportion of down-weighted sites to monitor changes in tree topology and to identify a set of candidate tree topologies for further consideration.'

  title: 'TreeFormer: A transformer-based tree rearrangement operation for phylogenetic reconstruction'
  container-title: bioRxiv
  publisher: Evolutionary Biology
  genre: preprint
  abstract: 'Phylogenetic inference is a fundamental problem in biology,
    which studies the origins and evolutionary relationships among species.
    Popular phylogenetic inference methods, such as IQ-TREE, RAxML, and PHYML,
    typically utilize heuristic tree search algorithms to seek a phylogenetic
    tree that maximizes the likelihood of the observed genetic data. However,
    tree search is time-consuming and often prone to local optima. To address
    these issues, we introduce TreeFormer, a new machine learning-based tree
    rearrangement operation for tree search. Experimental results show that
    TreeFormer achieves higher accuracy than FastTree 2 when reconstructing
    trees from real alignments with fewer than 1000 sites.'

  title: 'Rate variation and recurrent sequence errors in pandemic-scale phylogenetics'
  container-title: bioRxiv
  publisher: Evolutionary Biology
  genre: preprint
  abstract: Phylogenetic analyses of genome sequences from infectious pathogens reveal
   essential information regarding their evolution and transmission, as seen
   during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Recently developed pandemic-scale phylogenetic inference methods reduce the
   computational demand of phylogenetic reconstruction from genomic epidemiological
   datasets, allowing the analysis of millions of closely related genomes.
   However, widespread homoplasies, due to recurrent mutations and sequence errors,
   cause phylogenetic uncertainty and biases.
   We present new algorithms and models to substantially improve the computational
   performance and accuracy of pandemic-scale phylogenetics. In particular,
   we account for, and identify, mutation rate variation and recurrent
   sequence errors. We reconstruct reliable and public sequence
   alignment and phylogenetic tree of > 2 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes
   encapsulating the evolutionary history and global spread of the virus
   up to February 2023.

- abstract: Phylogenetics has a central role in evolutionary biology and
    genomic epidemiology1. Assessing phylogenetic confidence and
    reliability is therefore crucial and the methods that do this, such
    as those derived from Felsenstein's bootstrap2, are among the most
    widely used in modern science. However, these methods require
    enormous computational capacity, and are unsuitable for large
    datasets. Furthermore, most of these methods emerge from a focus on
    the membership of clades (groupings of taxa), which makes their
    results difficult to interpret in the context of genomic
    epidemiology. Here we propose subtree pruning and regrafting-based
    tree assessment (SPRTA), an efficient and interpretable approach to
    assess confidence in phylogenetic trees. SPRTA shifts the paradigm
    of phylogenetic support measurement from evaluating the confidence
    in clades to evolution histories and phylogenetic placement---for
    example, assessing whether a lineage evolved from another considered
    lineage, which is particularly valuable in genomic epidemiology. We
    use SPRTA to investigate a global public SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic
    tree relating more than two million genomes, highlighting plausible
    alternative evolutionary origins of many SARS-CoV-2 variants,
    assessing reliability in the Pango outbreak lineage classification
    system3, and demonstrating the effect of phylogenetic uncertainty on
    inferred mutation rates. Our results show that SPRTA enables
    pandemic-scale and detailed probabilistic assessment of transmission
    and mutational histories. Our method introduces a new approach to
    assessing phylogenetic confidence, enhancing the interpretability of
    pandemic-scale phylogenetic analyses and improving our ability to
    prepare for and respond to future pandemics.

  title: 'A robustly rooted tree of eukaryotes reveals their excavate ancestry'
  container-title: Nature
  page: 974–981
  volume: 640
  abstract: The eukaryote Tree of Life (eToL) depicts the relationships among
    all eukaryotic organisms; its root represents the last eukaryotic common
    ancestor (LECA) from which all extant complex lifeforms are descended.
    Locating this root is crucial for reconstructing the features of LECA,
    both as the endpoint of eukaryogenesis and the start-point for the
    evolution of the myriad complex traits underpinning the diversification
    of living eukaryotes. However, the position of the root remains contentious
    due to pervasive phylogenetic artefacts stemming from inadequate evolutionary
    models, poor taxon sampling, and limited phylogenetic signal. Here, we
    estimate the root of the eToL with unprecedented resolution based on
    a new, much larger, dataset of mitochondrial proteins which includes
    all known eukaryotic supergroups. Our comprehensive analyses with
    state-of-the-art phylogenetic models reveal that the eukaryotic
    root lies between two multi-supergroup assemblages ‘Opimoda+’ and
    ‘Diphoda+’. Compellingly, this position is consistently supported
    across different models and robustness analyses. Notably, groups
    containing ‘typical excavates’ are placed on both sides of the root,
    suggesting the complex features of the ‘excavate’ cell architecture
    trace back to LECA. This study is the most comprehensive phylogenetic
    investigation of the eukaryote root to date, shedding light on the
    ancestral cells from which extant eukaryotes arose and providing a
    crucial framework for investigating the origin and evolution of
    canonical eukaryotic features.

  title: 'MixtureFinder: Estimating DNA mixture models for phylogenetic analyses'
  container-title: Molecular Biology and Evolution
  page: msae264
  volume: '42'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: In phylogenetic studies, both partitioned models and mixture models are
   used to account for heterogeneity in molecular evolution among the sites of DNA 
   sequence alignments. Partitioned models require the user to specify the grouping 
   of sites into subsets, and then assume that each subset of sites can be modelled 
   by a single common process. Mixture models do not require users to pre-specify 
   subsets of sites, and instead calculate the likelihood of every site under every 
   model, while co-estimating the model weights. While much research has gone into 
   the optimisation of partitioned models by merging user-specified subsets, there 
   has been less attention paid to the optimisation of mixture models for DNA 
   sequence alignments. In this study, we first ask whether a key assumption of 
   partitioned models - that each user-specified subset can be modelled by a single 
   common process - is supported by the data. Having shown that this is not the case, 
   we then design, implement, test, and apply an algorithm, MixtureFinder, to select 
   the optimum number of classes for a mixture model of Q matrices for the standard 
   models of DNA sequence evolution. We show this algorithm performs well on simulated 
   and empirical datasets and suggest that it may be useful for future empirical 
   studies. MixtureFinder is available in IQ-TREE2, and a tutorial for using 
   MixtureFinder can be found here

  title: Order of amino acid recruitment into the genetic code resolved by last universal
    common ancestor’s protein domains
  container-title: PNAS
  page: e2410311121
  volume: '121'
  issue: '52'
  abstract: 'The current “consensus” order in which amino acids were added
    to the genetic code is based on potentially biased criteria such as absence of
    sulfur-containing amino acids from the Urey-Miller experiment in which no sulfur
    was added. Here, we reassess this order by exploiting the fact that proteins that
    emerged prior to the genetic code’s completion are likely enriched in early amino
    acids and depleted in late amino acids. We identify the most ancient protein-coding
    sequences born prior to the archaeal-bacterial split. Amino acid usage in protein
    sequences whose ancestors date back to a single homolog in the Last Universal
    Common Ancestor (LUCA) largely matches the consensus order. However, our findings
    indicate that metal-binding (cysteine and histidine) and sulfur-containing (cysteine
    and methionine) amino acids were added to the genetic code much earlier than previously
    thought. Surprisingly, even more ancient protein sequences — those that had already
    diversified into multiple distinct copies in LUCA — show a different pattern to
    single copy LUCA sequences: significantly less depleted in the late amino acids
    tryptophan and tyrosine, and enriched rather than depleted in phenylalanine. This
    is compatible with at least some of these sequences predating the current genetic
    code. Their distinct enrichment patterns thus provide hints about earlier, alternative
    genetic codes.'

  title: 'GTRpmix: A linked general-time reversible model for profile mixture models'
  title-short: GTRpmix
  container-title: Molecular Biology and Evolution
  page: msae134
  volume: '92'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Profile mixture models capture distinct biochemical constraints on the amino acid substitution process at different sites in proteins. These models feature a mixture of time-reversible models with a common matrix of exchangeabilities and distinct sets of equilibrium amino acid frequencies known as profiles. Combining the exchangeability matrix with each profile generates the matrix of instantaneous rates of amino acid exchange for that profile. Currently, empirically estimated exchangeability matrices (e.g., the LG matrix) are widely used for phylogenetic inference under profile mixture models. However, these were estimated using a single profile and are unlikely optimal for profile mixture models. Here, we describe the GTRpmix model that allows maximum likelihood estimation of a common exchangeability matrix under any profile mixture model. We show that exchangeability matrices estimated under profile mixture models differ from the LG matrix, dramatically improving model fit and topological estimation accuracy for empirical test cases. Because the GTRpmix model is computationally expensive, we provide two exchangeability matrices estimated from large concatenated phylogenomic-supermatrices to be used for phylogenetic analyses. One, called Eukaryotic Linked Mixture (ELM), is designed for phylogenetic analysis of proteins encoded by nuclear genomes of eukaryotes, and the other, Eukaryotic and Archaeal Linked mixture (EAL), for reconstructing relationships between eukaryotes and Archaea. These matrices, combined with profile mixture models, fit data better and have improved topology estimation relative to the LG matrix combined with the same mixture models. Starting with version 2.3.1, IQ-TREE2 allows users to estimate linked exchangeabilities (i.e. amino acid exchange rates) under profile mixture models.

  title: 'MAST: Phylogenetic Inference with Mixtures Across Sites and Trees'
  title-short: MAST
  container-title: Systematic Biology
  page: '375–391'
  volume: '73'
  issue: '2'
  publisher: Oxford Academic
  abstract: Hundreds or thousands of loci are now routinely used in modern phylogenomic
    studies. Concatenation approaches to tree inference assume that there is a single
    topology for the entire dataset, but different loci may have different evolutionary
    histories due to incomplete lineage sorting, introgression, and/or horizontal
    gene transfer; even single loci may not be treelike due to recombination. To overcome
    this shortcoming, we introduce the mixture across sites and trees (MAST) model,
    which uses a mixture of bifurcating trees to represent multiple histories in a
    single concatenated alignment. The MAST model allows each tree to have its own
    topology, branch lengths, substitution model, nucleotide or amino acid frequencies,
    and model of rate heterogeneity across sites. We implemented the MAST model in
    a maximum-likelihood framework in the popular phylogenetic software, IQ-TREE.
    Simulations show that we can accurately recover the true model parameters, including
    branch lengths and tree weights (i.e. frequencies) for a given set of tree topologies.
    We also show that we can use standard statistical inference approaches to reject
    a single-tree model when data are simulated under multiple trees (and vice versa).
    We applied the MAST model to multiple primate datasets and found that it can recover
    the signal of incomplete lineage sorting in the Great Apes, as well as the asymmetry
    in minor trees caused by introgression among several macaque species. When applied
    to a dataset of four Platyrrhine species for which standard concatenated maximum
    likelihood and gene tree approaches disagree, we find that MAST gives the highest
    weight to the tree favored by gene tree approaches. These results suggest that
    the MAST model is able to analyse a concatenated alignment using maximum likelihood,
    while avoiding some of the biases that come with assuming there is only a single
    tree. The MAST model can therefore offer unique biological insights when applied
    to datasets with multiple evolutionary histories. We discuss how it can be extended
    in the future.

  title: Perianth evolution and implications for generic delimitation in the eucalypts
    (Myrtaceae), including the description of the new genus, *blakella*
  container-title: Journal of Systematics and Evolution
  page: '942-962'
  volume: '62'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: AbstractEucalypts (Myrtaceae tribe Eucalypteae) are currently placed in
    seven genera. Traditionally, Eucalyptus was defined by its operculum, but when
    phylogenies placed Angophora , with free sepals and petals, as sister to the operculate
    bloodwood eucalypts, the latter were segregated into a new genus, Corymbia . Yet,
    generic delimitation in the tribe Eucalypteae remains uncertain. Here, we address
    these problems using phylogenetic analysis with the largest molecular data set
    to date. We captured 101 low‐copy nuclear exons from 392 samples representing
    266 species. Our phylogenetic analysis used maximum likelihood (IQtree) and multispecies
    coalescent (Astral). At two nodes critical to generic delimitation, we tested
    alternative relationships among Arillastrum , Angophora , Eucalyptus , and Corymbia
    using Shimodaira’s approximately unbiased test. Phylogenetic mapping was used
    to explore the evolution of perianth traits. Monophyly of Corymbia relative to
    Angophora was decisively rejected. All alternative relationships among the seven
    currently recognized Eucalypteae genera imply homoplasy in the evolutionary origins
    of the operculum. Inferred evolutionary transitions in perianth traits are congruent
    with divergences between major clades, except that the expression of separate
    sepals and petals in Angophora , which is nested within the operculate genus Corymbia
    , appears to be a reversal to the plesiomorphic perianth structure. Here, we formally
    raise Corymbia subg. Blakella to genus rank and make the relevant new combinations.
    We also define and name three sections within Blakella ( Blakella sect. Blakella
    , Blakella sect. Naviculares , and Blakella sect. Maculatae ), and two series
    within Blakella sect. Maculatae ( Blakella ser. Maculatae and Blakella ser. Torellianae
    ). Corymbia is reduced to the red bloodwoods.

  title-short: AliSim-HPC
  container-title: Bioinformatics
  page: btad540
  volume: '39'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: AbstractMotivation Sequence simulation plays a vital role in phylogenetics
    with many applications, such as evaluating phylogenetic methods, testing hypotheses,
    and generating training data for machine-learning applications. We recently introduced
    a new simulator for multiple sequence alignments called Ali-Sim, which outperformed
    existing tools. However, with the increasing demands of simulating large data
    sets, AliSim is still slow due to its sequential implementation; for example,
    to simulate millions of sequence alignments, AliSim took several days or weeks.
    Parallelization has been used for many phylogenetic inference methods but not
    yet for sequence simulation.Results This paper introduces AliSim-HPC, which, for
    the first time, employs high-performance computing for phylogenetic simulations.
    AliSim-HPC parallelizes the simulation process at both multi-core and multi-CPU
    levels using the OpenMP and MPI libraries, respectively. AliSim-HPC is highly
    efficient and scalable, which reduces the runtime to simulate 100 large gap-free
    alignments (30,000 sequences of one million sites) from over one day to 11 minutes
    using 256 CPU cores from a cluster with 6 computing nodes, a 153-fold speedup.
    While the OpenMP version can only simulate gap-free alignments, the MPI version
    supports insertion-deletion models like the sequential AliSim.Availability AliSim-HPC
    is open source and available as part of the new IQ-TREE version v2.2.3 at https://github.com/iqtree/iqtree2/releases

  title: 'DecentTree: Scalable Neighbour-Joining for the Genomic Era'
  title-short: DecentTree
  container-title: Bioinformatics
  page: btad536
  volume: '39'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: AbstractMotivation Neighbour-Joining is one of the most widely used distance-based
    phylogenetic inference methods. However, current implementations do not scale
    well for datasets with more than 10,000 sequences. Given the increasing pace of
    generating new sequence data, particularly in outbreaks of emerging diseases,
    and the already enormous existing databases of sequence data for which NJ is a
    useful approach, new implementations of existing methods are warranted.Results
    Here we present DecentTree, which provides highly optimised and parallel implementations
    of Neighbour-Joining and several of its variants. DecentTree is designed as a
    stand-alone application and a header-only library easily integrated with other
    phylogenetic software (e.g., it is integral in the popular IQ-TREE software).
    We show that DecentTree shows similar or improved performance over existing software
    (BIONJ, Quicktree, FastME, and RapidNJ), especially for handling very large alignments.
    For example, DecentTree is up to 6-fold faster than the fastest existing Neighbour-Joining
    software (e.g., RapidNJ) when generating a tree of 64,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.Availability
    DecentTree is open source and freely available at https://github.com/iqtree/decenttree.

  title: Maximum likelihood pandemic-scale phylogenetics
  container-title: Nature Genetics
  volume: '55'
  page: '746–752'
  abstract: Abstract Phylogenetics has a crucial role in genomic epidemiology. Enabled
    by unparalleled volumes of genome sequence data generated to study and help contain
    the COVID-19 pandemic, phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have shed light
    on the virus’s origins, spread, and the emergence and reproductive success of
    new variants. However, most phylogenetic approaches, including maximum likelihood
    and Bayesian methods, cannot scale to the size of the datasets from the current
    pandemic. We present ‘MAximum Parsimonious Likelihood Estimation’ (MAPLE), an
    approach for likelihood-based phylogenetic analysis of epidemiological genomic
    datasets at unprecedented scales. MAPLE infers SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies more accurately
    than existing maximum likelihood approaches while running up to thousands of times
    faster, and requiring at least 100 times less memory on large datasets. This extends
    the reach of genomic epidemiology, allowing the continued use of accurate phylogenetic,
    phylogeographic and phylodynamic analyses on datasets of millions of genomes.

  title: Updated site concordance factors minimize effects of homoplasy and taxon
    sampling
  container-title: Bioinformatics
  page: btac741
  volume: '39'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: AbstractMotivation Site concordance factors (sCFs) have become a widely
    used way to summarize discordance in phylogenomic datasets. However, the original
    version of sCFs was calculated by sampling a quartet of tip taxa and then applying
    parsimony-based criteria for discordance. This approach has the potential to be
    strongly affected by multiple hits at a site (homoplasy), especially when substitution
    rates are high or taxa are not closely related.Results Here, we introduce a new
    method for calculating sCFs. The updated version uses likelihood to generate probability
    distributions of ancestral states at internal nodes of the phylogeny. By sampling
    from the states at internal nodes adjacent to a given branch, this approach substantially
    reduces—but does not abolish—the effects of homoplasy and taxon sampling.Availability
    and implementation Updated sCFs are implemented in IQ-TREE 2.2.2. The software
    is freely available at https://github.com/iqtree/iqtree2/releases.Supplementary

  abstract: Abstract Sequence simulators play an important role in phylogenetics.
    Simulated data has many applications, such as evaluating the performance of different
    methods, hypothesis testing with parametric bootstraps, and, more recently, generating
    data for training machine-learning applications. Many sequence simulation programs
    exist, but the most feature-rich programs tend to be rather slow, and the fastest
    programs tend to be feature-poor. Here, we introduce AliSim, a new tool that can
    efficiently simulate biologically realistic alignments under a large range of
    complex evolutionary models. To achieve high performance across a wide range of
    simulation conditions, AliSim implements an adaptive approach that combines the
    commonly-used rate matrix and probability matrix approaches. AliSim takes 1.4
    hours and 1.3 GB RAM to simulate alignments with one million sequences or sites,
    while popular software Seq-Gen, Dawg, and INDELible require two to five hours
    and 50 to 500 GB of RAM. We provide AliSim as an extension of the IQ-TREE software
    version 2.2, freely available at www.iqtree.org, and a comprehensive user tutorial
    at http://www.iqtree.org/doc/AliSim.

  title: '<span class="nocase">nQMaker</span>: Estimating Time Nonreversible Amino
    Acid Substitution Models'
  title-short: <span class="nocase">nQMaker</span>
  container-title: Systematic Biology
  page: '1110-1123'
  volume: '71'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Abstract Amino acid substitution models are a key component in phylogenetic
    analyses of protein sequences. All commonly used amino acid models available to
    date are time-reversible, an assumption designed for computational convenience
    but not for biological reality. Another significant downside to time-reversible
    models is that they do not allow inference of rooted trees without outgroups.
    In this article, we introduce a maximum likelihood approach nQMaker, an extension
    of the recently published QMaker method, that allows the estimation of time nonreversible
    amino acid substitution models and rooted phylogenetic trees from a set of protein
    sequence alignments. We show that the nonreversible models estimated with nQMaker
    are a much better fit to empirical alignments than pre-existing reversible models,
    across a wide range of data sets including mammals, birds, plants, fungi, and
    other taxa, and that the improvements in model fit scale with the size of the
    data set. Notably, for the recently published plant and bird trees, these nonreversible
    models correctly recovered the commonly estimated root placements with very high-statistical
    support without the need to use an outgroup. We provide nQMaker as an easy-to-use
    feature in the IQ-TREE software (http://www.iqtree.org), allowing users to estimate
    nonreversible models and rooted phylogenies from their own protein data sets.

  container-title: Systematic Biology
  page: '959-972'
  volume: '71'

  abstract: Abstract Using time-reversible Markov models is a very common practice
    in phylogenetic analysis, because although we expect many of their assumptions
    to be violated by empirical data, they provide high computational efficiency.
    However, these models lack the ability to infer the root placement of the estimated
    phylogeny. In order to compensate for the inability of these models to root the
    tree, many researchers use external information such as using outgroup taxa or
    additional assumptions such as molecular clocks. In this study, we investigate
    the utility of nonreversible models to root empirical phylogenies and introduce
    a new bootstrap measure, the rootstrap, which provides information on the statistical
    support for any given root position. \[Bootstrap; nonreversible models; phylogenetic

  title: A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the serpin superfamily
  container-title: Molecular Biology and Evolution
  page: 2915–2929
  volume: 38
  issue: 7
  abstract: Abstract Serine protease inhibitors (serpins) are found in all kingdoms
    of life and play essential roles in multiple physiological processes. Owing to
    the diversity of the superfamily, phylogenetic analysis is challenging and prokaryotic
    serpins have been speculated to have been acquired from Metazoa through horizontal
    gene transfer (HGT) due to their unexpectedly high homology. Here we have leveraged
    a structural alignment of diverse serpins to generate a comprehensive 6000-sequence
    phylogeny that encompasses serpins from all kingdoms of life. We show that in
    addition to a central “hub” of highly conserved serpins, there has been extensive
    diversification of the superfamily into many novel functional clades. Our analysis
    indicates that the hub proteins are ancient and are similar because of convergent
    evolution, rather than the alternative hypothesis of HGT. This work clarifies
    longstanding questions in the evolution of serpins and provides new directions
    for research in the field of serpin biology.

    evolution'

  abstract: Abstract Amino acid substitution models play a crucial role in phylogenetic
    analyses. Maximum likelihood (ML) methods have been proposed to estimate amino
    acid substitution models, however, they are typically complicated and slow. In
    this paper, we propose QMaker, a new ML method to estimate a general time-reversible
    Q matrix from a large protein dataset consisting of multiple sequence alignments.
    QMaker combines an efficient ML tree search algorithm, a model selection for handling
    the model heterogeneity among alignments, and the consideration of rate mixture
    models among sites. We provide QMaker as a user-friendly function in the IQ-TREE
    software package (http://www.iqtree.org) supporting the use of multiple CPU cores
    so that biologists can easily estimate amino acid substitution models from their
    own protein alignments. We used QMaker to estimate new empirical general amino
    acid substitution models from the current Pfam database as well as five clade-specific
    models for mammals, birds, insects, yeasts, and plants. Our results show that
    the new models considerably improve the fit between model and data and in some
    cases influence the inference of phylogenetic tree topologies.

  title: Primate phylogenomics uncovers multiple rapid radiations and ancient interspecific
    introgression
  container-title: PLOS Biology
  page: 'e3000954'
  volume: '18'
  issue: '12'
  abstract: 'Our understanding of the evolutionary history of primates is undergoing
    continual revision due to ongoing genome sequencing efforts. Bolstered by growing
    fossil evidence, these data have led to increased acceptance of once controversial
    hypotheses regarding phylogenetic relationships, hybridization and introgression,
    and the biogeographical history of primate groups. Among these findings is a pattern
    of recent introgression between species within all major primate groups examined
    to date, though little is known about introgression deeper in time. To address
    this and other phylogenetic questions, here, we present new reference genome assemblies
    for 3 Old World monkey (OWM) species: Colobus angolensis ssp. palliatus (the black
    and white colobus), Macaca nemestrina (southern pig-tailed macaque), and Mandrillus
    leucophaeus (the drill). We combine these data with 23 additional primate genomes
    to estimate both the species tree and individual gene trees using thousands of
    loci. While our species tree is largely consistent with previous phylogenetic
    hypotheses, the gene trees reveal high levels of genealogical discordance associated
    with multiple primate radiations. We use strongly asymmetric patterns of gene
    tree discordance around specific branches to identify multiple instances of introgression
    between ancestral primate lineages. In addition, we exploit recent fossil evidence
    to perform fossil-calibrated molecular dating analyses across the tree. Taken
    together, our genome-wide data help to resolve multiple contentious sets of relationships
    among primates, while also providing insight into the biological processes and
    technical artifacts that led to the disagreements in the first place.'

  title: 'Newly Emerged Serotype 1c of Shigella flexneri: Multiple Origins and Changing
    Drug Resistance Landscape'
  title-short: Newly Emerged Serotype 1c of Shigella flexneri
  container-title: Genes
  page: '1042'
  volume: '11'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: Bacillary dysentery caused by Shigella flexneri is a major cause of under-five
    mortality in developing countries, where a novel S. flexneri serotype 1c has become
    very common since the 1980s. However, the origin and diversification of serotype
    1c remain poorly understood. To understand the evolution of serotype 1c and their
    antimicrobial resistance, we sequenced and analyzed the whole-genome of 85 clinical
    isolates from the United Kingdom, Egypt, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Japan belonging
    to serotype 1c and related serotypes of 1a, 1b and Y/Yv. We identified up to three
    distinct O-antigen modifying genes in S. flexneri 1c strains, which were acquired
    from three different bacteriophages. Our analysis shows that S. flexneri 1c strains
    have originated from serotype 1a and serotype 1b strains after the acquisition
    of bacteriophage-encoding gtrIc operon. The maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis
    using core genes suggests two distinct S. flexneri 1c lineages, one specific to
    Bangladesh, which originated from ancestral serotype 1a strains and the other
    from the United Kingdom, Egypt, and Vietnam originated from ancestral serotype
    1b strains. We also identified 63 isolates containing multiple drug-resistant
    genes in them conferring resistance against streptomycin, sulfonamide, quinolone,
    trimethoprim, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and beta-lactamase. Furthermore,
    antibiotic susceptibility assays showed 83 (97.6%) isolates as either complete
    or intermediate resistance to the WHO-recommended first- and second-line drugs.
    This changing drug resistance pattern demonstrates the urgent need for drug resistance
    surveillance and renewed treatment guidelines.

  page: 2727-2733
  volume: '37'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: 'We implement two measures for quantifying genealogical
    concordance in phylogenomic datasets: the gene concordance factor (gCF) and the
    site concordance factor (sCF). For every branch of a reference tree, gCF is defined
    as the percentage of decisive gene trees containing that branch. This measure
    is already in wide usage, but here we introduce a package that calculates it while
    accounting for variable taxon coverage among gene trees. sCF is a new measure
    defined as the percentage of decisive sites supporting a branch in the reference
    tree. gCF and sCF complement classical measures of branch support in phylogenetics
    by providing a full description of underlying disagreement among loci and sites.
    An easy to use implementation and tutorial is

  title: 'GHOST: Recovering Historical Signal from Heterotachously Evolved Sequence
    Alignments'
  title-short: GHOST
  container-title: Systematic Biology
  page: '249-264'
  volume: '69'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Abstract Molecular sequence data that have evolved under the influence
    of heterotachous evolutionary processes are known to mislead phylogenetic inference.
    We introduce the General Heterogeneous evolution On a Single Topology (GHOST)
    model of sequence evolution, implemented under a maximum-likelihood framework
    in the phylogenetic program IQ-TREE (http://www.iqtree.org). Simulations show
    that using the GHOST model, IQ-TREE can accurately recover the tree topology,
    branch lengths, and substitution model parameters from heterotachously evolved
    sequences. We investigate the performance of the GHOST model on empirical data
    by sampling phylogenomic alignments of varying lengths from a plastome alignment.
    We then carry out inference under the GHOST model on a phylogenomic data set composed
    of 248 genes from 16 taxa, where we find the GHOST model concurs with the currently
    accepted view, placing turtles as a sister lineage of archosaurs, in contrast
    to results obtained using traditional variable rates-across-sites models. Finally,
    we apply the model to a data set composed of a sodium channel gene of 11 fish
    taxa, finding that the GHOST model is able to elucidate a subtle component of
    the historical signal, linked to the previously established convergent evolution
    of the electric organ in two geographically distinct lineages of electric fish.
    We compare inference under the GHOST model to partitioning by codon position and
    show that, owing to the minimization of model constraints, the GHOST model offers
    unique biological insights when applied to empirical data.

  title: The Prevalence and Impact of Model Violations in Phylogenetic Analysis
  container-title: Genome Biology and Evolution
  page: '3341-3352'
  volume: '11'
  issue: '12'
  abstract: Abstract In phylogenetic inference, we commonly use models of substitution
    which assume that sequence evolution is stationary, reversible, and homogeneous
    (SRH). Although the use of such models is often criticized, the extent of SRH
    violations and their effects on phylogenetic inference of tree topologies and
    edge lengths are not well understood. Here, we introduce and apply the maximal
    matched-pairs tests of homogeneity to assess the scale and impact of SRH model
    violations on 3,572 partitions from 35 published phylogenetic data sets. We show
    that roughly one-quarter of all the partitions we analyzed (23.5%) reject the
    SRH assumptions, and that for 25% of data sets, tree topologies inferred from
    all partitions differ significantly from topologies inferred using the subset
    of partitions that do not reject the SRH assumptions. This proportion increases
    when comparing trees inferred using the subset of partitions that rejects the
    SRH assumptions, to those inferred from partitions that do not reject the SRH
    assumptions. These results suggest that the extent and effects of model violation
    in phylogenetics may be substantial. They highlight the importance of testing
    for model violations and possibly excluding partitions that violate models prior
    to tree reconstruction. Our results also suggest that further effort in developing
    models that do not require SRH assumptions could lead to large improvements in
    the accuracy of phylogenomic inference. The scripts necessary to perform the analysis
    are available in https://github.com/roblanf/SRHtests, and the new tests we describe
    are available as a new option in IQ-TREE (http://www.iqtree.org).

  title: Combined transcriptome and proteome profiling reveals specific molecular
    brain signatures for sex, maturation and circalunar clock phase
  container-title: eLife
  page: 'e41556'
  volume: '8'
  abstract: 'Many marine animals, ranging from corals to fishes, synchronise reproduction
    to lunar cycles. In the annelid Platynereis dumerilii, this timing is orchestrated
    by an endogenous monthly (circalunar) clock entrained by moonlight. Whereas daily
    (circadian) clocks cause extensive transcriptomic and proteomic changes, the quality
    and quantity of regulations by circalunar clocks have remained largely elusive.
    By establishing a combined transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approach, we
    provide first systematic insight into the molecular changes in Platynereis heads
    between circalunar phases, and across sexual differentiation and maturation. Whereas
    maturation elicits large transcriptomic and proteomic changes, the circalunar
    clock exhibits only minor transcriptomic, but strong proteomic regulation. Our
    study provides a versatile extraction technique and comprehensive resources. It
    corroborates that circadian and circalunar clock effects are likely distinct and
    identifies key molecular brain signatures for reproduction, sex and circalunar
    clock phase. Examples include prepro-whitnin/proctolin and ependymin-related proteins
    as circalunar clock targets. , Like many other sea creatures, the worm Platynereis
    dumerilii reproduces by dispersing eggs and sperm in the water. For these animals,
    timing is everything: if they fail coordinate their release, the precious reproductive
    cells will drift in the vastness of the ocean without ever meeting their male
    or female counterparts. Internal clocks are a set of mechanisms that allow organisms
    to tune their internal processes to their environment. For example, the circadian
    clock helps many creatures to adapt to the cycle of day and night. This involves
    switching genes on and off according to the time of day. When a gene is activated,
    its information is copied into a molecule of RNA, which is then read to create
    proteins that will go on performing specific roles. To produce their eggs and
    sperm at the right time, P. dumerilii worms rely on a poorly understood internal
    clock which is synchronized by the moon cycle. To investigate this ‘inner calendar’,
    Schenk, Bannister et al. developed a new technique that allows them to extract
    both RNA and proteins from the miniscule heads of the worms. The results showed
    that the internal clock synchronized by the lunar phases influenced the levels
    of many more proteins than RNA molecules. In comparison, other life events such
    as the worms becoming sexually mature, had a more similar impact on both protein
    and RNA regulation. This might suggest that the inner calendar that coordinates
    the worms with the moon cycle could work by changing protein, rather than RNA
    levels. The analysis also highlighted several molecular actors that may be essential
    for the worm’s inner clock to work properly. In the future, the new technique
    will help to dissect more finely how P. dumerilii and many other marine creatures
    stay synchronized with the moon, and spawn at the right time.'

  title: 'Phylogenomics in the pandemic era'
  container-title: PhD Theses
  abstract: Phylogenetic inference is fundamental in biology, elucidating evolutionary
    relationships among organisms and shedding light on species’ origins. During
    the COVID-19 pandemic, phylogenetic methods are pivotal in discovering the
    origin, detecting new SARS-CoV-2 variants, and guiding public health decisions.
    Phylogenetics also plays a key role in understanding Earth’s biodiversity, spanning
    from the origins of life billions of years ago to the evolution of modern species such as
    plants and animals. We are now in the genomic era where the ever-growing genomic
    data poses new challenges - making existing phylogenetic tools intractable, calling
    for an urgent need for new efficient methods. To fill this gap, I developed several
    new phylogenetic methods tailored for large-scale genomic data....

  title: 'Phylogenetic Model Selection via Machine Learning'
  container-title: Master Theses
  abstract: "Phylogenetic inference, which reconstructs evolutionary trees from DNA or amino acid sequences, is crucial for understanding the evolutionary histories of species on Earth. Model selection is a fundamental step in this process, determining the best-fit model for the data. However, classic maximum likelihood-based methods for model selection are computationally intensive. This study introduces a machine learning-based framework for amino acid model selection, consisting of three components: protFinder for selecting the best-fit substitution model, RHASFinder for identifying the appropriate rate heterogeneity model, and protFFinder for determining the use of empirical pre-estimated frequencies. Our framework is an order of magnitude faster than the widely used ModelFinder, while maintaining comparable accuracy."

  title: 'QuartetNet: Novel Phylogenetic Quartet Tree Reconstruction Using Neural Networks'
  container-title: Honours Theses
  abstract: Phylogenetic reconstruction is fundamental problem in bioinformatics that studies the
    origins and evolutionary of species. Traditionally, statistical inference methods have
    been used to reconstruct phylogentic tree from a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)
    of species, visualising the evolutionary history using a tree structure. However, those
    methods are either inaccurate or time-consuming. Supervised machine learning, as an
    fast yet accurate alternative, can be used to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree by predicting
    the topology and branch lengths of the tree. In this study, we propose QuartetNet, a
    novel phylogentic reconstruction framework that uses neural networks (NNs) for reconstructing
    quartet (4-species) trees. Through comparative analysis, QuartetNet is shown
    to either match or surpass the performance of stat-of-the-art domain method.

  title: 'Computational Methods in Biodiversity Conservation'
  container-title: PhD Theses
  abstract: Conservation genetics is an emerging discipline that aims at employing genetic methods
    to questions in biodiversity conservation. One main achievement of the  eld is the
    application of phylogenetic trees to assess the diversity of species (Vane-Wright et al.,
    1991). Phylogenetic diversity (PD) is a quantitative measure proposed by Faith (1992)
    that assigns to a set of species the sum of the lengths of the branches connecting the
    species of interest. If the branch lengths reflect evolutionary distances, PD will be
    equivalent to the amount of phylogenetic information accumulated by these species. PD
    therefore aims at preserving as much evolutionary history of species as possible...

  title: A test statistic to quantify treelikeness in phylogenetics
  container-title: bioRxiv
  publisher: Evolutionary Biology
  genre: preprint
  abstract: Most phylogenetic analyses assume that the evolutionary history of an
    alignment (either that of a single locus, or of multiple concatenated loci) can
    be described by a single bifurcating tree, the so-called the treelikeness assumption.
    Treelikeness can be violated by biological events such as recombination, introgression,
    or incomplete lineage sorting, and by systematic errors in phylogenetic analyses.
    The incorrect assumption of treelikeness may then mislead phylogenetic inferences.
    To quantify and test for treelikeness in alignments, we develop a test statistic
    which we call the tree proportion. This statistic quantifies the proportion of
    the edge weights in a phylogenetic network that are represented in a bifurcating
    phylogenetic tree of the same alignment. We extend this statistic to a statistical
    test of treelikeness using a parametric bootstrap. We use extensive simulations
    to compare tree proportion to a range of related approaches. We show that tree
    proportion successfully identifies non-treelikeness in a wide range of simulation
    scenarios, and discuss its strengths and weaknesses compared to other approaches.
    The power of the tree-proportion test to reject non-treelike alignments can be
    lower than some other approaches, but these approaches tend to be limited in their
    scope and/or the ease with which they can be interpreted. Our recommendation is
    to test treelikeness of sequence alignments with both tree proportion and mosaic
    methods such as 3Seq. The scripts necessary to replicate this study are available

  title: 'Are fleas highly modified Mecoptera? Phylogenomic resolution of Antliophora
    (Insecta: Holometabola)'
  title-short: Are fleas highly modified Mecoptera?
  container-title: bioRxiv
  publisher: Evolutionary Biology
  genre: preprint
  abstract: AbstractInsect orders have been defined and stable for decades, with few
    notable exceptions ( e.g ., Blattodea and Psocoptera). One of the few remaining
    questions of order-level monophyly is that of Mecoptera in respect to the phylogenetic
    placement of Siphonaptera (fleas). We used a large set of transcriptomic nucleotide
    sequence data representing 56 species and more than 3,000 single-copy genes to
    resolve the evolutionary history of Antliophora, including fleas (Siphonaptera),
    scorpionflies and relatives (Mecoptera), and true flies (Diptera). We find that
    fleas and mecopterans together are the sister group of flies. However, our data
    and/or analyses are unable to distinguish whether fleas are sister to a monophyletic
    Mecoptera, or whether they arose from within extant mecopteran families, rendering
    Mecoptera paraphyletic. We did not detect parameter bias in our dataset after
    applying a broad range of detection methods. Counter to a previous hypothesis
    that placed fleas within Mecoptera as the sister group to wingless boreids (snow
    fleas), we found a potential sister group relationship between fleas and the enigmatic
    family Nannochoristidae. Although we lack conclusive evidence, it seems possible
    that fleas represent the most-species rich group of modern mecopterans and that
    their parasitic lifestyle and morphological adaptations have simply made them
    unrecognizable in respect to their order-level classification.
