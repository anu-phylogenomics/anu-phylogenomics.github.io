  title: 'Are fleas highly modified Mecoptera? Phylogenomic resolution of Antliophora
    (Insecta: Holometabola)'
  title-short: Are fleas highly modified Mecoptera?
  container-title: bioRxiv
  publisher: Evolutionary Biology
  genre: preprint
  abstract: AbstractInsect orders have been defined and stable for decades, with few
    notable exceptions ( e.g ., Blattodea and Psocoptera). One of the few remaining
    questions of order-level monophyly is that of Mecoptera in respect to the phylogenetic
    placement of Siphonaptera (fleas). We used a large set of transcriptomic nucleotide
    sequence data representing 56 species and more than 3,000 single-copy genes to
    resolve the evolutionary history of Antliophora, including fleas (Siphonaptera),
    scorpionflies and relatives (Mecoptera), and true flies (Diptera). We find that
    fleas and mecopterans together are the sister group of flies. However, our data
    and/or analyses are unable to distinguish whether fleas are sister to a monophyletic
    Mecoptera, or whether they arose from within extant mecopteran families, rendering
    Mecoptera paraphyletic. We did not detect parameter bias in our dataset after
    applying a broad range of detection methods. Counter to a previous hypothesis
    that placed fleas within Mecoptera as the sister group to wingless boreids (snow
    fleas), we found a potential sister group relationship between fleas and the enigmatic
    family Nannochoristidae. Although we lack conclusive evidence, it seems possible
    that fleas represent the most-species rich group of modern mecopterans and that
    their parasitic lifestyle and morphological adaptations have simply made them
    unrecognizable in respect to their order-level classification.

  title: A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the serpin superfamily
  container-title: bioRxiv
  publisher: Bioinformatics
  genre: preprint
  abstract: Serine protease inhibitors (serpins) are found in all kingdoms of life
    and play essential roles in multiple physiological processes. Owing to the diversity
    of the superfamily, phylogenetic analysis is challenging and prokaryotic serpins
    have been speculated to have been acquired from Metazoa through horizontal gene
    transfer (HGT) due to their unexpectedly high homology. Here we have leveraged
    a structural alignment of diverse serpins to generate a comprehensive 6000-sequence
    phylogeny that encompasses serpins from all kingdoms of life. We show that in
    addition to a central “hub” of highly conserved serpins, there has been extensive
    diversification of the superfamily into many novel functional clades. Our analysis
    indicates that the hub proteins are ancient and are similar because of convergent
    evolution, rather than the alternative hypothesis of HGT. This work clarifies
    longstanding questions in the evolution of serpins and provides new directions
    for research in the field of serpin biology.

  title: 'Assessing Confidence in Root Placement on Phylogenies: An Empirical Study
    Using Non-Reversible Models'
  title-short: Assessing Confidence in Root Placement on Phylogenies
  container-title: bioRxiv
  publisher: Evolutionary Biology
  genre: preprint
  abstract: 'Using time-reversible Markov models is a very common practice in phylogenetic
    analysis, because although we expect many of their assumptions to be violated
    by empirical data, they provide high computational efficiency. However, these
    models lack the ability to infer the root placement of the estimated phylogeny.
    In order to compensate for the inability of these models to root the tree, many
    researchers use external information such as using outgroup taxa or additional
    assumptions such as molecular-clocks. In this study, we investigate the utility
    of non-reversible models to root empirical phylogenies and introduce a new bootstrap
    measure, the rootstrap, which provides information on the statistical support
    for any given root position. Availability and implementation: A python script
    for calculating rootstrap support values is available at https://github.com/suhanaser/Rootstrap.'

  title: 'QMaker: Fast and accurate method to estimate empirical models of protein
    evolution'
  title-short: QMaker
  container-title: bioRxiv
  publisher: Submitted
  genre: preprint
  abstract: Amino acid substitution models play a crucial role in phylogenetic analyses.
    Maximum likelihood (ML) methods have been proposed to estimate amino acid substitution
    models, however, they are typically complicated and slow. In this paper, we propose
    QMaker, a new ML method to estimate a general time-reversible Q matrix from a
    large protein dataset consisting of multiple sequence alignments. QMaker combines
    an efficient ML tree search algorithm, a model selection for handling the model
    heterogeneity among alignments, and the consideration of rate mixture models among
    sites. We provide QMaker as a user-friendly function in the IQ-TREE software package
    (http://www.iqtree.org) supporting the use of multiple CPU cores so that biologists
    can easily estimate amino acid substitution models from their own protein alignments.
    We used QMaker to estimate new empirical general amino acid substitution models
    from the current Pfam database as well as five clade-specific models for mammals,
    birds, insects, yeasts, and plants. Our results show that the new models considerably
    improve the fit between model and data and in some cases influence the inference
    of phylogenetic tree topologies.

  title: Primate phylogenomics uncovers multiple rapid radiations and ancient interspecific
    introgression
  container-title: PLOS Biology
  page: 'e3000954'
  volume: '18'
  issue: '12'
  abstract: 'Our understanding of the evolutionary history of primates is undergoing
    continual revision due to ongoing genome sequencing efforts. Bolstered by growing
    fossil evidence, these data have led to increased acceptance of once controversial
    hypotheses regarding phylogenetic relationships, hybridization and introgression,
    and the biogeographical history of primate groups. Among these findings is a pattern
    of recent introgression between species within all major primate groups examined
    to date, though little is known about introgression deeper in time. To address
    this and other phylogenetic questions, here, we present new reference genome assemblies
    for 3 Old World monkey (OWM) species: Colobus angolensis ssp. palliatus (the black
    and white colobus), Macaca nemestrina (southern pig-tailed macaque), and Mandrillus
    leucophaeus (the drill). We combine these data with 23 additional primate genomes
    to estimate both the species tree and individual gene trees using thousands of
    loci. While our species tree is largely consistent with previous phylogenetic
    hypotheses, the gene trees reveal high levels of genealogical discordance associated
    with multiple primate radiations. We use strongly asymmetric patterns of gene
    tree discordance around specific branches to identify multiple instances of introgression
    between ancestral primate lineages. In addition, we exploit recent fossil evidence
    to perform fossil-calibrated molecular dating analyses across the tree. Taken
    together, our genome-wide data help to resolve multiple contentious sets of relationships
    among primates, while also providing insight into the biological processes and
    technical artifacts that led to the disagreements in the first place.'

  title: 'Newly Emerged Serotype 1c of Shigella flexneri: Multiple Origins and Changing
    Drug Resistance Landscape'
  title-short: Newly Emerged Serotype 1c of Shigella flexneri
  container-title: Genes
  page: '1042'
  volume: '11'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: Bacillary dysentery caused by Shigella flexneri is a major cause of under-five
    mortality in developing countries, where a novel S. flexneri serotype 1c has become
    very common since the 1980s. However, the origin and diversification of serotype
    1c remain poorly understood. To understand the evolution of serotype 1c and their
    antimicrobial resistance, we sequenced and analyzed the whole-genome of 85 clinical
    isolates from the United Kingdom, Egypt, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Japan belonging
    to serotype 1c and related serotypes of 1a, 1b and Y/Yv. We identified up to three
    distinct O-antigen modifying genes in S. flexneri 1c strains, which were acquired
    from three different bacteriophages. Our analysis shows that S. flexneri 1c strains
    have originated from serotype 1a and serotype 1b strains after the acquisition
    of bacteriophage-encoding gtrIc operon. The maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis
    using core genes suggests two distinct S. flexneri 1c lineages, one specific to
    Bangladesh, which originated from ancestral serotype 1a strains and the other
    from the United Kingdom, Egypt, and Vietnam originated from ancestral serotype
    1b strains. We also identified 63 isolates containing multiple drug-resistant
    genes in them conferring resistance against streptomycin, sulfonamide, quinolone,
    trimethoprim, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and beta-lactamase. Furthermore,
    antibiotic susceptibility assays showed 83 (97.6%) isolates as either complete
    or intermediate resistance to the WHO-recommended first- and second-line drugs.
    This changing drug resistance pattern demonstrates the urgent need for drug resistance
    surveillance and renewed treatment guidelines.

  title: New methods to calculate concordance factors for phylogenomic datasets
  container-title: Molecular Biology and Evolution
  page: 2727-2733
  volume: '37'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: 'We implement two measures for quantifying genealogical
    concordance in phylogenomic datasets: the gene concordance factor (gCF) and the
    site concordance factor (sCF). For every branch of a reference tree, gCF is defined
    as the percentage of decisive gene trees containing that branch. This measure
    is already in wide usage, but here we introduce a package that calculates it while
    accounting for variable taxon coverage among gene trees. sCF is a new measure
    defined as the percentage of decisive sites supporting a branch in the reference
    tree. gCF and sCF complement classical measures of branch support in phylogenetics
    by providing a full description of underlying disagreement among loci and sites.

  title: 'GHOST: Recovering Historical Signal from Heterotachously Evolved Sequence
    Alignments'
  title-short: GHOST
  container-title: Systematic Biology
  page: '249-264'
  volume: '69'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Abstract Molecular sequence data that have evolved under the influence
    of heterotachous evolutionary processes are known to mislead phylogenetic inference.
    We introduce the General Heterogeneous evolution On a Single Topology (GHOST)
    model of sequence evolution, implemented under a maximum-likelihood framework
    in the phylogenetic program IQ-TREE (http://www.iqtree.org). Simulations show
    that using the GHOST model, IQ-TREE can accurately recover the tree topology,
    branch lengths, and substitution model parameters from heterotachously evolved
    sequences. We investigate the performance of the GHOST model on empirical data
    by sampling phylogenomic alignments of varying lengths from a plastome alignment.
    We then carry out inference under the GHOST model on a phylogenomic data set composed
    of 248 genes from 16 taxa, where we find the GHOST model concurs with the currently
    accepted view, placing turtles as a sister lineage of archosaurs, in contrast
    to results obtained using traditional variable rates-across-sites models. Finally,
    we apply the model to a data set composed of a sodium channel gene of 11 fish
    taxa, finding that the GHOST model is able to elucidate a subtle component of
    the historical signal, linked to the previously established convergent evolution
    of the electric organ in two geographically distinct lineages of electric fish.
    We compare inference under the GHOST model to partitioning by codon position and
    show that, owing to the minimization of model constraints, the GHOST model offers
    unique biological insights when applied to empirical data.

  title: The Prevalence and Impact of Model Violations in Phylogenetic Analysis
  container-title: Genome Biology and Evolution
  page: '3341-3352'
  volume: '11'
  issue: '12'
  abstract: Abstract In phylogenetic inference, we commonly use models of substitution
    which assume that sequence evolution is stationary, reversible, and homogeneous
    (SRH). Although the use of such models is often criticized, the extent of SRH
    violations and their effects on phylogenetic inference of tree topologies and
    edge lengths are not well understood. Here, we introduce and apply the maximal
    matched-pairs tests of homogeneity to assess the scale and impact of SRH model
    violations on 3,572 partitions from 35 published phylogenetic data sets. We show
    that roughly one-quarter of all the partitions we analyzed (23.5%) reject the
    SRH assumptions, and that for 25% of data sets, tree topologies inferred from
    all partitions differ significantly from topologies inferred using the subset
    of partitions that do not reject the SRH assumptions. This proportion increases
    when comparing trees inferred using the subset of partitions that rejects the
    SRH assumptions, to those inferred from partitions that do not reject the SRH
    assumptions. These results suggest that the extent and effects of model violation
    in phylogenetics may be substantial. They highlight the importance of testing
    for model violations and possibly excluding partitions that violate models prior
    to tree reconstruction. Our results also suggest that further effort in developing
    models that do not require SRH assumptions could lead to large improvements in
    the accuracy of phylogenomic inference. The scripts necessary to perform the analysis
    are available in https://github.com/roblanf/SRHtests, and the new tests we describe
    are available as a new option in IQ-TREE (http://www.iqtree.org).

    by an endogenous monthly (circalunar) clock entrained by moonlight. Whereas daily
    (circadian) clocks cause extensive transcriptomic and proteomic changes, the quality
    and quantity of regulations by circalunar clocks have remained largely elusive.
    By establishing a combined transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approach, we
    provide first systematic insight into the molecular changes in Platynereis heads
    between circalunar phases, and across sexual differentiation and maturation. Whereas
    maturation elicits large transcriptomic and proteomic changes, the circalunar
    clock exhibits only minor transcriptomic, but strong proteomic regulation. Our
    study provides a versatile extraction technique and comprehensive resources. It
    corroborates that circadian and circalunar clock effects are likely distinct and
    identifies key molecular brain signatures for reproduction, sex and circalunar
    clock phase. Examples include prepro-whitnin/proctolin and ependymin-related proteins
    as circalunar clock targets. , Like many other sea creatures, the worm Platynereis
    dumerilii reproduces by dispersing eggs and sperm in the water. For these animals,
    timing is everything: if they fail coordinate their release, the precious reproductive
    cells will drift in the vastness of the ocean without ever meeting their male
    or female counterparts. Internal clocks are a set of mechanisms that allow organisms
    to tune their internal processes to their environment. For example, the circadian
    clock helps many creatures to adapt to the cycle of day and night. This involves
    switching genes on and off according to the time of day. When a gene is activated,
    its information is copied into a molecule of RNA, which is then read to create
    proteins that will go on performing specific roles. To produce their eggs and
    sperm at the right time, P. dumerilii worms rely on a poorly understood internal
    clock which is synchronized by the moon cycle. To investigate this ‘inner calendar’,
    Schenk, Bannister et al. developed a new technique that allows them to extract
    both RNA and proteins from the miniscule heads of the worms. The results showed
    that the internal clock synchronized by the lunar phases influenced the levels
    of many more proteins than RNA molecules. In comparison, other life events such
    as the worms becoming sexually mature, had a more similar impact on both protein
    and RNA regulation. This might suggest that the inner calendar that coordinates
    the worms with the moon cycle could work by changing protein, rather than RNA
    levels. The analysis also highlighted several molecular actors that may be essential
    for the worm’s inner clock to work properly. In the future, the new technique
    will help to dissect more finely how P. dumerilii and many other marine creatures
    stay synchronized with the moon, and spawn at the right time.'
