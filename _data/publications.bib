            In phylogenetic inference, we commonly use models of substitution which assume that sequence evolution is stationary, reversible, and homogeneous (SRH). Although the use of such models is often criticized, the extent of SRH violations and their effects on phylogenetic inference of tree topologies and edge lengths are not well understood. Here, we introduce and apply the maximal matched-pairs tests of homogeneity to assess the scale and impact of SRH model violations on 3,572 partitions from 35 published phylogenetic data sets. We show that roughly one-quarter of all the partitions we analyzed (23.5\%) reject the SRH assumptions, and that for 25\% of data sets, tree topologies inferred from all partitions differ significantly from topologies inferred using the subset of partitions that do not reject the SRH assumptions. This proportion increases when comparing trees inferred using the subset of partitions that rejects the SRH assumptions, to those inferred from partitions that do not reject the SRH assumptions. These results suggest that the extent and effects of model violation in phylogenetics may be substantial. They highlight the importance of testing for model violations and possibly excluding partitions that violate models prior to tree reconstruction. Our results also suggest that further effort in developing models that do not require SRH assumptions could lead to large improvements in the accuracy of phylogenomic inference. The scripts necessary to perform the analysis are available in https://github.com/roblanf/SRHtests, and the new tests we describe are available as a new option in IQ-TREE (http://www.iqtree.org).},

            IQ-TREE (
            http://www.iqtree.org
            ) is a user-friendly and widely used software package for phylogenetic inference using maximum likelihood. Since the release of version 1 in 2014, we have continuously expanded IQ-TREE to integrate a plethora of new models of sequence evolution and efficient computational approaches of phylogenetic inference to deal with genomic data. Here, we describe notable features of IQ-TREE version 2 and highlight the key advantages over other software.},

            Molecular sequence data that have evolved under the influence of heterotachous evolutionary processes are known to mislead phylogenetic inference. We introduce the General Heterogeneous evolution On a Single Topology (GHOST) model of sequence evolution, implemented under a maximum-likelihood framework in the phylogenetic program IQ-TREE (http://www.iqtree.org). Simulations show that using the GHOST model, IQ-TREE can accurately recover the tree topology, branch lengths, and substitution model parameters from heterotachously evolved sequences. We investigate the performance of the GHOST model on empirical data by sampling phylogenomic alignments of varying lengths from a plastome alignment. We then carry out inference under the GHOST model on a phylogenomic data set composed of 248 genes from 16 taxa, where we find the GHOST model concurs with the currently accepted view, placing turtles as a sister lineage of archosaurs, in contrast to results obtained using traditional variable rates-across-sites models. Finally, we apply the model to a data set composed of a sodium channel gene of 11 fish taxa, finding that the GHOST model is able to elucidate a subtle component of the historical signal, linked to the previously established convergent evolution of the electric organ in two geographically distinct lineages of electric fish. We compare inference under the GHOST model to partitioning by codon position and show that, owing to the minimization of model constraints, the GHOST model offers unique biological insights when applied to empirical data.},

	title = {New methods to calculate concordance factors for phylogenomic datasets},
	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/487801},
	abstract = {Summary: We introduce and implement two measures for quantifying genealogical concordance in phylogenomic datasets: the gene concordance factor (gCF) and the site concordance factor (sCF). For every branch of a reference tree, gCF is defined as the percentage of decisive gene trees containing that branch. This measure is already in wide usage, but here we introduce a package that calculates it while accounting for variable taxon coverage among gene trees. sCF is a new measure defined as the percentage of decisive sites supporting a branch in the reference tree. gCF and sCF complement classical measures of branch support in phylogenetics by providing a full description of underlying disagreement among loci and sites. Availability and Implementation: An easy to use implementation and tutorial is freely available in the IQ-TREE software (http://www.iqtree.org).

	abstract = {Many marine animals, ranging from corals to fishes, synchronise reproduction to lunar cycles. In the annelid Platynereis dumerilii, this timing is orchestrated by an endogenous monthly (circalunar) clock entrained by moonlight. Whereas daily (circadian) clocks cause extensive transcriptomic and proteomic changes, the quality and quantity of regulations by circalunar clocks have remained largely elusive. By establishing a combined transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approach, we provide first systematic insight into the molecular changes in Platynereis heads between circalunar phases, and across sexual differentiation and maturation. Whereas maturation elicits large transcriptomic and proteomic changes, the circalunar clock exhibits only minor transcriptomic, but strong proteomic regulation. Our study provides a versatile extraction technique and comprehensive resources. It corroborates that circadian and circalunar clock effects are likely distinct and identifies key molecular brain signatures for reproduction, sex and circalunar clock phase. Examples include prepro-whitnin/proctolin and ependymin-related proteins as circalunar clock targets.
          , 
            Like many other sea creatures, the worm Platynereis dumerilii reproduces by dispersing eggs and sperm in the water. For these animals, timing is everything: if they fail coordinate their release, the precious reproductive cells will drift in the vastness of the ocean without ever meeting their male or female counterparts.
            Internal clocks are a set of mechanisms that allow organisms to tune their internal processes to their environment. For example, the circadian clock helps many creatures to adapt to the cycle of day and night. This involves switching genes on and off according to the time of day. When a gene is activated, its information is copied into a molecule of RNA, which is then read to create proteins that will go on performing specific roles. To produce their eggs and sperm at the right time, P. dumerilii worms rely on a poorly understood internal clock which is synchronized by the moon cycle.
            To investigate this ‘inner calendar’, Schenk, Bannister et al. developed a new technique that allows them to extract both RNA and proteins from the miniscule heads of the worms. The results showed that the internal clock synchronized by the lunar phases influenced the levels of many more proteins than RNA molecules. In comparison, other life events such as the worms becoming sexually mature, had a more similar impact on both protein and RNA regulation. This might suggest that the inner calendar that coordinates the worms with the moon cycle could work by changing protein, rather than RNA levels. The analysis also highlighted several molecular actors that may be essential for the worm’s inner clock to work properly. In the future, the new technique will help to dissect more finely how P. dumerilii and many other marine creatures stay synchronized with the moon, and spawn at the right time.},
