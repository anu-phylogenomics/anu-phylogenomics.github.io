# Research

## Our mission: Enable evolutionary research in the genomic era

Motivated by the rapid accumulation of high throughput sequencing data,
our research focuses on developing efficient bioinformatics methods,
statistical models, algorithms and high performance computing techniques
for phylogenetic inference from ultra-large genomic data. 

### Computational methods for phylogenomics

We want to develop efficient methods and algorithms for phylogenetic 
inference from ultra-large genomic data. A significant outcome of
this research theme are three widely-used methods representing three
key steps in every phylogenetic analysis:

* ModelFinder: fast and accurate model selection,
* IQ-TREE: effective tree search algorithm, and
* UFBoot: ultrafast bootstrap approximation (UFBoot).

### Advanced models of sequence evolution

Driven by the rapid growth of large phylogenomic datasets coupled with
increasing impact of model violation, we have developed many new
statistical models for phylogenomics including partition models,
polymorphism-aware models, distribution free models, mixture models and
site-specific models. Many advanced models have been implemented in
IQ-TREE, representing the first time availability in a prominent maximum
likelihood framework.

### Bioinformatics software

A significant outcome from this research theme is the widely used
[IQ-TREE phylogenetic software](www.iqtree.org), which has been
continuously developed since 2011. IQ-TREE has received a lot of user
enthusiasms and integrated in many phylogenetic pipelines. IQ-TREE has jointly been developed
by an international team from Australia, Austria, and Hungary.


### Phylogenetic applications 

Applications play an important role in our search, not only to show the
usefulness of the methods but also to identify potential
limitations of existing models. We have collaborated with many
biologists to analyse empirical datasets and answer many unresolved questions
across the Tree of Life.
